# Image-Classification-Zyro
The project involves building an image classification system using a convolutional neural network (CNN). 
It includes data preprocessing, model training, and integration with a Flask web application. 
The trained model is deployed to classify user-uploaded images. 
Challenges include dataset preparation, model architecture selection, deployment, and ensuring a user-friendly interface. 
The code utilizes PyTorch for deep learning and Flask for web development.
The html is used for frontend.
